#### Node.js Application with CI/CD Pipeline

This repository contains a Node.js application along with a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline to automate the process from code checkout to deployment.

## Setup Instructions:

### 1. Server Provisioning
- I am using AWS as the Cloud Provider
- Provision an EC2 instance on AWS with a secure Linux distribution (e.g., Amazon Linux 2023).
- Configure security groups to allow necessary incoming traffic and restrict unnecessary access.
- Generate and configure SSH key pairs for secure remote acces.
